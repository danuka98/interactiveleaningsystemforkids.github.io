                                <h4>Background and Literature Review</h4>
                                <p>The rate at which children are beginning to use sophisticated devices, most commonly to play mobile games, has increased in tandem with the technological advancements of the present age, which is commonly referred to as the "jet age." These children have a propensity to pick up new skills and behaviors from the video and graphic content they consume. In addition to this, the children have a significant amount of homework to complete, which makes it impossible for them to organize their work. Learning in a classroom setting is typically dull for children, and they have difficulty retaining information while they are being taught using this method. This raises the question of why children learn faster through the viewing of video and graphics content rather than through the more conventional teaching methods used in the classroom. The answer to this question is that in this day and age, everyone is digitalized. in addition to that, there is a wide variety of software for working with media to be learned. Therefore, these applications provided some learning materials to children, which increased their capacity to learn and supported them in doing so.

                                    It appears that today's youth are no longer interested in learning through the more conventional methods used in the classroom. Up until this point, there have been many educators, young people, and other people who are not interested in learning and making use of the conventional instructional approach found in classrooms. The goal of this project is to create an application for mobile devices that will make learning the alphabet more engaging for children. Therefore, in order to provide a superior experience, this application utilizes real-time processing.
                                    
                                    Izzat Fauzi Bin Hamidi et al, in this research, aimed to develop a mobile application as an exciting and interactive way of learning the basic Jawi alphabet for kids using augmented reality technology. This application enables AR technology, which is different than a regular application. Using this method, can makes AR beneficial for education. And this combing with the narrator and sound will provide a better understanding of the kids that want to learn Jawi.
                                    
                                    Ammar H. Safar et al, in this experimental research study, scrutinized the effectiveness of using augmented reality (AR) applications (apps) as a teaching and learning tool when instructing kindergarten children in the English alphabet in the State of Kuwait. and also, this study compared two groups: experimental, taught using AR apps, and control, taught using traditional face-to-face methods [2]. In addition, this study concludes with relevant proposals and recommendations regarding the implementation of AR technology in education and suggests undertaking further studies on this interesting topic.
                                    
                                    Besides, Vikram Kamath et al, have been carrying out the behavioral prediction of a person through automated handwriting analysis. In this study handwriting is analyzed through Image Processing in MATLAB [3]. The behavioral pattern of the person is predicted from the above traits of handwriting. The developed system identifies handwriting closely with real-time processing and involves less image preprocessing. And the system is in good agreement with more than 80%. In addition, a new method is proposed for automated behavioral analysis using Automated Handwriting Analysis System (AHWAS).</p>

                                <h4>Research Gap</h4>
                                <p>A closer look at the literature reveals that several mobile applications for learning Alphabet for kids are available worldwide, with slightly similar functionalities and features. Nonetheless, most previously developed applications allow children to draw a letter on a provided letter-shaped image or recognize handwriting. The majority of prior applications have provided alphabet letter images first and then instructed children to draw the letter on the provided image.

                                    However, according to the present author's perspective, those types of methods did not allow children to attain proper knowledge about letters. Hence, drawing on the previously provided image will not allow children to learn for themselves. Overcoming
                                    
                                    the above limitations, the current study aims to explore new methods for teaching and enhancing kids' writing skills on the alphabet by themselves.
                                    
                                    Based on that, the present author intends to cover an unstudied area by developing an alphabet hand drawing learning application that provides significantly different learning outcomes than previously developed applications. In this study, innovative methods will be used by concentrating on each stage of kids' alphabet learning methods to give the best accurate result.
                                    
                                    Furthermore, this application expands its innovative hand-drawn procedure, which includes predicting whatsoever kids are drawing on the screen and identifying mistakes in the basic drawing, in order to show the correct way to draw the letter by the software itself. Not only that, but the proposed application will also show kids the way of writing a good professional letter with the intention of providing kids with a better understanding.
                                    
                                    According to that, this study will make a novel contribution by investigating a new alphabet learning system based on electronic hand-drawn procedures, which will provide an opportunity for kids to learn about the alphabet in a magnificent memorable way.</p>

                                <p>PA good education should be provided for every single child. To ensure that a child's physical health continues to be in good shape throughout their primary education, it is essential that they receive instruction on basic topics like hygiene and cleanliness. Both active play and structured play can help a child develop the social skills and participation abilities necessary for school and life.

                                    A young child's time spent in elementary and primary education is the most formative period of their education because the majority of the skills and information they acquire during this time will shape the rest of their lives. Because of this, teachers in elementary schools need to exercise extreme caution. If they do not provide the developing child with support in order for them to develop their skills and identify
                                    
                                    their values, it will result in the misguidance of a genius. According to what we discovered, the most important aspects of a developing child are recognizing the most important objects (building a robust vocabulary), improving writing skills, recognizing patterns, and developing drawing skills. It is necessary to acquire this knowledge while being properly supervised. Children may not learn some fundamental concepts that are necessary for their continued education if there is no adult supervision.
                                    
                                    In the midst of a pandemic, there is no effective way to instruct children in the previously mentioned facts and fundamentals. This is due to the fact that children's mothers typically lack knowledge regarding specific facts and theories, and as was previously stated, any error in instruction will have an impact on the child's future. Therefore, it is our intention to propose an effective method of education for children in elementary and primary schools.</p>

                                <p>This research was conducted on the topic of Interactive Learning System for Kids which was designed to increase the learning efficiency of Kids. The end users of this application are primary age students. Existing systems and applications in this field have a number of drawbacks. As a result, our research provides a method for overcoming these obstacles and developing a system that allows users to use the services on offer in a comfortable manner. Therefore, current research is divided into four main components.<br>

                                        <h4>Methodology</h4>
                                        <p>This chapter explains the special steps of actions and methodologies that were used to develop the mobile application and its features. The methodology chapter for this study consists of the following key components: system architecture, application design, model creation, software solution, requirement gathering and analysis, and finally commercialization.This interactive learning system for kids incorporated four distinct categories of primary activities to create and design this application. As a consequence of this, the key features of this program are designed to provide assistance with the following activities: writing letters, drawing shapes, drawing images, and recognizing images. As per Figure 4.1.1 it has illustrated the main components of this entire study with key functions of each component briefly.

                                            The component known as hand drawn alphabet letters begins by giving users the opportunity to draw the alphabet's characters. After that, a space will be provided for you to draw a letter. It is expected that the system will recognize as a prediction any time a student draws an alphabet letter. The system then made a comparison between the letter that was drawn and the correct letter. The system will make an educated guess as to the letter of the alphabet that a student was trying to draw, even if the letter is drawn incorrectly or incompletely by the student. The drawn letter will be checked by the system to ensure that there are no errors in it. The suggestions provided by the system are in order to rectify those errors and produce an appropriate letter for the system's mistakes.
                                            
                                            The component that asks children to identify shapes provides them with a surface on which they can draw a variety of shapes. When they have finished drawing, the kids will be able to determine whether or not the sketch that they drew is an accurate representation. The grade that they were given for the drawing they had submitted was then shown to them if the sketch that they had drawn was accurate. When a child has drawn a shape incorrectly, the correct shape should be displayed next to it. In addition to this, the children are able to draw fundamental shapes, which they can then use to draw things such as flowers, houses, and stars. After you have completed the drawing, you should look it over and determine whether or not it is accurate. If the drawing is lacking in any way, the system will prompt the user with the message "Need to be Improved," which will appear on the screen.
                                            
                                            Students will be able to draw and color some objects on a surface that has been provided for them as part of the component involving hand-drawn objects using colors (Apple, Banana, Carrot). When they have finished drawing, the kids evaluate whether
                                            
                                            or not the sketch that they have drawn is accurate. The children are able to see the correct shape even if the shape they have drawn is incorrect. In addition, children's color knowledge is enhanced through participation in this component.
                                            
                                            When an image is provided to the application by means of the generate image caption using image context component, a caption will be generated automatically in accordance with the qualities and objects that are present on the image. This will be done in accordance with the image's context. During the time that they are looking at that picture, the student needs to formulate a brief sentence. After that, the sentence that was written by the children is compared to the sentence that was generated by the system to determine whether or not there are any differences. If they are in agreement with one another, then the sentence that the Kids wrote is correct. If they did not concur with one another, then the sentence that was written by the Kids has a mistake in it. By putting their attention on this aspect, children can see significant improvement in their capacity to write sentences that are clear and concise. </p>

                                <p> Introduction
                                    Various technological approaches have been utilized throughout the implementation of the various modules and functionalities. This part includes not only a discussion of the base programming language that will be used to construct the primary components of the system but also explanations of the intended database, integrated development environment (IDE), and libraries that will be implemented. This section will provide some insight on various technologies and their utilization inside the project so that you can obtain a general understanding of the technologies that are suggested for each individual module.
                                     Python
                                    
                                    Python is an interpreted high-level language designed for a wide range of applications. It is often considered to be the most widely used programming language in the world. Python is the primary programming language that we are utilizing for our project because it is simpler to comprehend than other OOP languages, such as Java, and because it has a large number of built-in and third-party libraries that support data mining, machine learning, image processing, and a variety of other mathematical algorithms.

                                    The Google Brain team is responsible for the development and maintenance of the famous machine learning framework known as Tensorflow. It is the same foundation that Google is now employing for its machine learning applications such as self-driving cars, image search, and automatic picture editing in Google images. Because of its capacity to perform machine learning and data mining methods in addition to picture modification,I have chosen to use framework in our project.
